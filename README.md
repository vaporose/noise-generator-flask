# Noise generator

This is just a basic-ish application for testing out noise generation functions. 

## Usage

I haven't set this up for installation yet, so just clone and run app.py (may need to set FLASK_ENV to "development" also)

## Functionality

Can generate a SUPER basic random image using OpenSimplex
